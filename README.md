# :book:Text Translation Glasses
In this project we are aiming to build a real-time text detection and translation glasses.   
What we are using :
- OpenCV
- Tesseract OCR
- Natural language Processing (NLP)
- Internet of Things (IoT)

OpenCV is an open source Computer Vision Library in which we can use many image related operations, in this   
project it is used to capture and modify real-time text from external camera. The text captured and modified    
is then processed by Tesseract-OCR to give output as coputer generated text.  
for actual Translation of text in many different languages is done by Natural Language Processing (NLP) a part   
of ML in which data sets of different language translations are given to train the model.  
After all this IoT part kicks in as the actual hardware takes care of all the operations and algorithms to  
perform in small computer and can be wear as regular glasses.
